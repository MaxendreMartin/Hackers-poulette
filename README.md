## The mission

My mission is to create a fully functional online "contact support" form, in _ PHP _. He must _ display a contact form _ and _ process the response received _ (sanitize, validate, respond to the user).

The form should be comprised of:

-   name and lastname
-   gender
-   email address
-   country
-   subject (3 possibilities)
-   message

## Here is the mockup what the page will look like
